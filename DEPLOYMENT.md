   - Ensure Python version is compatible
   - Check build logs for specific errors

2. **App Crashes**
   - Check application logs
   - Verify all required files are present
   - Test locally first

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Free tiers have limited RAM
   - Optimize your code if needed
   - Consider upgrading to paid tier

4. **Timeout Issues**
   - Free tiers have request timeouts
   - Optimize API calls
   - Consider caching strategies

## Performance Optimization

### For Free Tiers

1. **Minimize Dependencies**
   - Only include necessary packages in `requirements.txt`

2. **Optimize Code**
   - Use efficient data structures
   - Minimize API calls
   - Implement caching where possible

3. **Handle Timeouts**
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement retry logic
   - Show progress indicators

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit API keys to code
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

2. **HTTPS**
   - All hosting platforms provide HTTPS by default
   - Ensure your app works with HTTPS

3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file uploads
   - Implement rate limiting if needed

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Code Backup**
   - Your code is in GitHub (automatically backed up)
   - Keep local copies of important changes

2. **Data Backup**
   - This app doesn't store persistent data
   - All processing is done in memory

## Scaling Considerations

If you need more resources:

1. **Heroku**: Upgrade to Hobby plan ($7/month)
2. **Railway**: Upgrade to Pro plan ($5/month + usage)
3. **Render**: Upgrade to Starter plan ($7/month)

## Support

If you encounter deployment issues:

1. Check the hosting platform's documentation
2. Look at build/deployment logs
3. Test locally first
4. Check for common issues in this guide
